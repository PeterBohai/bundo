### Architecture
Bundo is a single-page application (SPA) website that's built off of the [MERN](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-mern-stack) Stack. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) was used to bootstrap the frontend and the domain is currently hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Token. The [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) hashing function, which is based on the [blowfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)) algorithm, is used for encryption.
